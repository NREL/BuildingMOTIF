    "This tutorial assumes that `BuildingMOTIF` has already been installed in the local environment.\n",

    "The purpose of this tutorial is to learn about model *validation* and how BuildingMOTIF can give useful feedback for fixing a model that has failed validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This tutorial has the following learning objectives:\n",
    "1. validating the model against an ***ontology*** to ensure that the model is a valid Brick model\n",
    "2. validating the model against a ***manifest***, which contains the metadata requirements for a specific model\n",
    "3. validating the model against a ***use case*** for a specific application\n",

    "```{margin}\n",

    " `Shapes` are functions that validate part of an RDF model. A `Shape` is a set of constraints, requirements, and/or rules that apply to entities in an RDF graph. A shape may represent many things, including:\n",
    "- the minimum points on an equipment required to execute a certain sequence of operations,\n",
    "- the internal details of an equipment: what parts it contains, etc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating a model is the process of ensuring that the model is both *correct* (uses the ontologies correctly) and *semantically sufficient* (it contains sufficient metadata to execute the desired applications or enable the desired use cases). Validation is always done with respect to sets of `Shapes` using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)[^1].\n",
